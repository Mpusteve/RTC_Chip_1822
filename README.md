# RTC_Chip_1822
D-Tech Real Time Clock chip source code.
This is the source code for the Microchip PIC12(L)F1822 based Real Time Clock chip.
It is based on an earlier design which had much higher static current consumption.
The current design uses a low power oscillator to achieve a static current consumption of 5 to 20uA depending on battery voltage.
It is compliled under Microchip MPLABX using the XC8 Compiler Version 2.0. (Binary Checksum 0x908A)
